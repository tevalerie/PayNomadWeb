# File Upload API Development

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements and implementation details for developing a secure file upload API for PayNomad Capital Ltd. This API will handle document uploads for client onboarding, financial statements, and other sensitive documents.

## API Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Support for multiple file types (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, JPG, PNG)
- Maximum file size: 10MB per file
- Batch upload capability (up to 5 files simultaneously)
- Progress tracking for uploads
- Resumable uploads for large files
- Automatic virus scanning of uploaded files
- Metadata association with uploaded files

### Security Requirements
- Secure file storage with encryption at rest
- Authentication and authorization for all upload requests
- File type validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Audit logging of all upload activities
- Compliance with financial industry regulations

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/uploads
**Purpose:** Upload a new file or batch of files

**Request Parameters:**
- `files`: Array of files to upload (multipart/form-data)
- `metadata`: JSON object with file metadata
- `category`: String indicating file category (e.g., "onboarding", "statements")

**Response:**
- `fileIds`: Array of unique identifiers for uploaded files
- `uploadStatus`: Status of each file upload
- `errors`: Any errors encountered during upload

### GET /api/uploads/{fileId}
**Purpose:** Retrieve metadata about an uploaded file

**Request Parameters:**
- `fileId`: Unique identifier for the file

**Response:**
- `fileName`: Original name of the file
- `fileSize`: Size of the file in bytes
- `uploadDate`: Date and time of upload
- `metadata`: Associated metadata
- `downloadUrl`: Temporary URL for downloading the file

### DELETE /api/uploads/{fileId}
**Purpose:** Delete an uploaded file

**Request Parameters:**
- `fileId`: Unique identifier for the file

**Response:**
- `success`: Boolean indicating successful deletion
- `message`: Status message

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Set Up Storage Infrastructure
- Configure secure cloud storage (AWS S3 or equivalent)
- Implement server-side encryption
- Set up appropriate access controls and policies
- Configure lifecycle management for temporary files

### Task 2: Develop Core Upload Functionality
- Implement multipart upload handling
- Develop file validation and sanitization
- Create metadata association mechanism
- Implement progress tracking and resumable uploads

### Task 3: Implement Security Measures
- Integrate with authentication system
- Implement rate limiting
- Set up virus scanning integration
- Develop audit logging system

### Task 4: Create API Documentation
- Document all endpoints with examples
- Create usage guides for front-end integration
- Document error codes and handling
- Provide security best practices

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all API endpoints
- Integration tests with front-end components
- Security testing (penetration testing)
- Performance testing under load
- Edge case testing (large files, invalid files)

## Collaboration Requirements

- Coordinate with the Security Agent for security review
- Work with the UI/UX Agent for front-end integration
- Collaborate with the AI Specialist for intelligent file processing

## Deliverables

- Fully functional file upload API
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Test suite with >90% coverage
- Security audit report
- Performance benchmark results
