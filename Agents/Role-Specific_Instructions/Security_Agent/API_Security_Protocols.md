# API Security Protocols

## Overview

This document outlines the security protocols for all APIs in the PayNomad Capital Ltd. project. As the Security Agent, you are responsible for ensuring that all APIs adhere to these protocols to protect sensitive financial data and maintain client trust.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Methods

1. **JWT-Based Authentication**
   - Implementation: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
   - Token Lifetime: Access tokens (15 minutes), Refresh tokens (7 days)
   - Rotation: Implement token rotation on refresh
   - Storage: Secure HttpOnly cookies with SameSite=Strict

2. **API Keys for Service-to-Service Communication**
   - Implementation: HMAC-signed requests with timestamp
   - Rotation: Automatic key rotation every 30 days
   - Storage: Secure environment variables, never in code repositories

### Authorization Framework

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Roles: Admin, Manager, Client, Guest
   - Permission Granularity: Resource-level permissions
   - Implementation: Claims-based authorization in JWT tokens

2. **Resource-Based Authorization**
   - Ownership Verification: Validate user ownership of resources
   - Delegation: Support for delegated access with audit trails

## Request/Response Security

### Input Validation

1. **Schema Validation**
   - Implementation: JSON Schema validation for all requests
   - Error Handling: Detailed validation errors without exposing internals

2. **Sanitization**
   - HTML/Script Sanitization: Prevent XSS attacks
   - SQL Injection Prevention: Parameterized queries only
   - Command Injection Prevention: Input sanitization for system commands

### Output Security

1. **Response Sanitization**
   - PII Redaction: Automatically redact sensitive information
   - Data Minimization: Return only necessary data

2. **Content Security**
   - Content-Security-Policy: Strict CSP headers
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY

## Transport Security

1. **TLS Configuration**
   - Minimum Version: TLS 1.2, prefer TLS 1.3
   - Cipher Suites: Strong ciphers only, disable weak algorithms
   - Certificate Management: Automated renewal, OCSP stapling

2. **API Gateway Security**
   - Rate Limiting: Tiered rate limits based on authentication
   - DDoS Protection: Implement AWS Shield or equivalent
   - Request Filtering: Block suspicious patterns at gateway level

## Monitoring and Incident Response

1. **Security Monitoring**
   - Real-time Monitoring: Log all API access with context
   - Anomaly Detection: Implement ML-based anomaly detection
   - Alerting: Immediate alerts for suspicious activities

2. **Incident Response**
   - Response Plan: Documented procedures for security incidents
   - Containment Strategy: Ability to block compromised tokens/accounts
   - Forensics: Detailed logging for post-incident analysis

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Authentication Implementation
- Implement JWT authentication system
- Set up secure token storage and transmission
- Develop token rotation mechanism
- Create API key management system

### Task 2: Authorization Framework
- Implement RBAC system
- Develop resource ownership verification
- Create permission management interface
- Test authorization edge cases

### Task 3: Request/Response Security
- Implement JSON Schema validation
- Set up input sanitization middleware
- Configure secure response headers
- Develop PII redaction system

### Task 4: Monitoring Setup
- Configure comprehensive API logging
- Set up real-time security monitoring
- Implement anomaly detection
- Create security dashboards

## Testing Requirements

- Penetration testing for all API endpoints
- Authentication bypass testing
- Authorization circumvention testing
- Injection attack testing (SQL, NoSQL, Command)
- Rate limiting and DDoS resilience testing

## Collaboration Requirements

- Coordinate with the Back-End Agent on implementation
- Work with the AI Specialist on anomaly detection
- Collaborate with the UI/UX Agent on secure form design

## Deliverables

- Security implementation documentation
- Penetration testing report
- Security monitoring dashboard
- Incident response playbook
- Developer security guidelines
