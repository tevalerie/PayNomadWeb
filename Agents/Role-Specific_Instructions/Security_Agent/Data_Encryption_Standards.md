# Data Encryption Standards

## Overview

This document outlines the encryption standards for all data within the PayNomad Capital Ltd. project. As the Security Agent, you are responsible for ensuring that all sensitive financial and personal data is properly encrypted both at rest and in transit.

## Data Classification

### Level 1: Public Data
- **Definition**: Information that can be freely disclosed to the public
- **Examples**: Published blog posts, service descriptions, public company information
- **Encryption Requirements**: None, but integrity protection recommended

### Level 2: Internal Data
- **Definition**: Information for internal use that wouldn't cause significant harm if disclosed
- **Examples**: Internal documentation, non-sensitive analytics, general user preferences
- **Encryption Requirements**: Encryption in transit required, encryption at rest recommended

### Level 3: Confidential Data
- **Definition**: Information that requires protection and would cause harm if disclosed
- **Examples**: User contact information, account details, transaction metadata
- **Encryption Requirements**: Strong encryption both in transit and at rest required

### Level 4: Restricted Data
- **Definition**: Highly sensitive information requiring the strictest protection
- **Examples**: Financial account numbers, authentication credentials, personal financial data
- **Encryption Requirements**: Strongest available encryption with additional access controls

## Encryption Standards

### Transport Encryption

1. **TLS Configuration**
   - Protocol: TLS 1.3 preferred, TLS 1.2 minimum
   - Cipher Suites: Only strong AEAD ciphers (e.g., AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
   - Key Exchange: ECDHE with P-256 or X25519
   - Certificate: 2048-bit RSA or ECDSA with P-256 minimum
   - HSTS: Strict-Transport-Security with long max-age

2. **API Communication**
   - All API endpoints must use HTTPS
   - Certificate pinning for mobile applications
   - Mutual TLS for service-to-service communication

### Data at Rest Encryption

1. **Database Encryption**
   - Algorithm: AES-256-GCM for table-level encryption
   - Key Management: AWS KMS or equivalent for key management
   - Field-Level Encryption: For Level 4 data fields

2. **File Storage Encryption**
   - Algorithm: AES-256-GCM for file encryption
   - Key Management: Envelope encryption with regular key rotation
   - Metadata: Encrypted separately from file content

3. **Application Secrets**
   - Storage: AWS Secrets Manager or equivalent
   - Access: IAM roles with least privilege
   - Rotation: Automatic rotation schedule

### End-to-End Encryption

1. **Secure Messaging**
   - Protocol: Signal Protocol or equivalent
   - Perfect Forward Secrecy: Required
   - Implementation: Open-source libraries with security audits

2. **Secure Document Sharing**
   - Encryption: Client-side encryption before upload
   - Key Management: Separate key distribution channel
   - Access Control: Time-limited access with audit logs

## Key Management

1. **Key Hierarchy**
   - Master Keys: Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
   - Data Encryption Keys: Generated per data set
   - Key Encryption Keys: Protect Data Encryption Keys

2. **Key Rotation**
   - Master Keys: Annual rotation
   - Data Encryption Keys: Quarterly rotation
   - Session Keys: New key per session

3. **Key Storage**
   - Production: AWS KMS or equivalent cloud KMS
   - Development: Secure local storage with access controls
   - Backup: Secure offline storage with multi-person access control

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Transport Security Implementation
- Configure TLS settings on all endpoints
- Implement certificate management and rotation
- Set up HSTS and secure headers
- Test TLS configuration with security scanners

### Task 2: Database Encryption
- Implement table-level encryption
- Set up field-level encryption for sensitive fields
- Configure secure key management
- Develop key rotation procedures

### Task 3: File Storage Security
- Implement secure file storage with encryption
- Set up secure file sharing mechanisms
- Configure access controls and audit logging
- Test file encryption/decryption performance

### Task 4: Key Management System
- Set up cloud KMS integration
- Develop key hierarchy and management procedures
- Implement key rotation automation
- Create key backup and recovery procedures

## Testing Requirements
